## Resources
This is my go to for syntax and simple things that I may have forgotten. I would recommend starting here.
<br>https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp

This is similar to a fundamental Computer Science course where you learn the essentials: recursion, sorting/searching, object oriented coding, etc.

Kaggle has impressed me with their (free) Learning courses, and they're really good! If you're past the fundamentals, then I would recommend Pandas, then Machine Learning.

This course below can be found on Coursera. This is a very laid back course (on your own time and pace), but the concepts are so good! They also give you access to GCP to test out code.
