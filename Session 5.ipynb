    "</body>\n",
    "\n",
    "</html>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll find that the `<head>` tag is mostly for housekeeping like specifying the page title and adding meta tags. Meta tags are in essence information about the page that web crawlers see but users do not. The head tag also contains links to javascript and css files, which you'll see later in the lesson.\n",
    "\n",
    "The website content goes in the `<body>` tag. The body tag can contain headers, paragraphs, images, links, forms, lists, and a handful of other tags. Of particular note in this example are the link tag `<a>` and the image tag `<img>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both of these tags link to external information outside of the html doc. In the html code above, the link `<a>` tag links to an external website called w3schools. The href is called an attribute, and in this case href specifies the link.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first image `<img>` tag displays an image called \"photo.jpg\". In this case, the jpg file and the html document are in the same directory, but the documents do not have to be. The src attribute specifies the path to the image file relative to the html document. The alt tag contains text that gets displaced in case the image cannot be found. The image `<img>` tag displays an image that is found on the web."

    "# Flask\n",
    "Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions. However, Flask supports extensions that can add application features as if they were implemented in Flask itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Flask?\n",
    "- First and foremost, you'll be working with Flask because it is written in Python. You won't need to learn a new programming language.\n",
    "- Flask is also a relatively simple framework, so it's good for making a small web app.\n",
    "- Because Flask is written in Python, you can use Flask with any other Python library including pandas, numpy and scikit-learn. In this lesson, you'll be deploying a data dashboard and pandas will help get the data ready.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Running Example\n",
    "All you need to do to run the Flask app is to open a Terminal, `cd` into the flask_example folder, and type:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "python run.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "The app should be running on http://0.0.0.0:3001/\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating New Pages\n",
    "To create a new web page, you first need to specify the route in the routes.py as well as the name of the html template.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@app.route('/new-route')\n",
    "def render_the_route():\n",
    "    return render_template('new_route.html')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The route name, function name, and template name do not have to match; however, it's good practice to make them similar so that the code is easier to follow.\n",
    "\n",
    "The new_route.html file must go in the templates folder. Flask automatically looks for html files in the templates folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Jinja\n",
    "Flask comes packaged with the powerful Jinja templating language.\n",
    "\n",
    "For those who have not been exposed to a templating language before, such languages essentially contain variables as well as some programming logic, which when evaluated (or rendered into HTML) are replaced with **actual values**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The variables and/or logic are placed between tags or delimiters. For example, Jinja templates use `{% ... %}` for expressions or logic (like for loops), while `{{ ... }}` is used for outputting the results of an expression or a variable to the end user. The latter tag, when rendered, is replaced with a value or values, and is seen by the end user.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Passing Data to Jinja\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow along with the example code found in the folder `2_flask+jinja_example`. The following code snippet is placed in `routes.py`:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@app.route('/newpage')\n",
    "def newpage():\n",
    "    return render_template('newpage.html', \n",
    "    my_string=\"Wheeeee!\", \n",
    "    my_list=[0,1,2,3,4,5])\n",
    "```\n",
    "You are able to pass many unique variables within the the render_template function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following code snippet is found in `newpage.html`:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "<div class=\"container\">\n",
    "  <p>My string: {{my_string}}</p>\n",
    "  <p>Third value from the list: {{my_list[3]}}</p>\n",
    "  <p>Loop through the list:</p>\n",
    "  <ul>\n",
    "    {% for n in my_list %}\n",
    "    <li>{{n}}</li>\n",
    "    {% endfor %}\n",
    "  </ul>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Template Inheritance in Jinja\n",
    "Templates usually take advantage of inheritance, which includes a single base template that defines the basic structure of all subsequent child templates. You use the tags {% extends %} and {% block %} to implement inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The use case for this is simple: as your application grows, and you continue adding new templates, you will need to keep common code (like an HTML navigation bar, Javascript libraries, CSS stylesheets, and so forth) in sync, which can be a lot of work. Using inheritance, we can move those common pieces to a parent/base template so that we can create or edit such code once, and all child templates will inherent that code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Base (or parent) template:\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<!DOCTYPE html>\n",
    "<html>\n",
    "  <head>\n",
    "    <title>Flask Template Example</title>\n",
    "    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n",
    "  </head>\n",
    "  <body>\n",
    "    <div class=\"container\">\n",
    "      <h2>This is part of my base template</h2>\n",
    "      <br>\n",
    "      {% block content %}{% endblock %}\n",
    "      <br>\n",
    "      <h2>This is part of my base template</h2>\n",
    "    </div>\n",
    "\n",
    "  </body>\n",
    "</html>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Did you notice the {% block %} tags? This defines a block (or area) that child templates can fill in. Further, this just informs the templating engine that a child template may override the block of the template.\n",
    "\n",
    "Child HTML File:\n",
    "```html\n",
    "{% extends \"parent.html\" %}\n",
    "{% block content %}\n",
    "  <h3> This is the start of my child template</h3>\n",
    "  <br>\n",
    "  <p>My string: {{my_string}}</p>\n",
    "  <p>Value from the list: {{my_list[3]}}</p>\n",
    "  <p>Loop through the list:</p>\n",
    "  <ul>\n",
    "    {% for n in my_list %}\n",
    "    <li>{{n}}</li>\n",
    "    {% endfor %}\n",
    "  </ul>\n",
    "  <h3> This is the end of my child template</h3>\n",
    "{% endblock %}\n",
    "```\n",
    "So, the {% extends %} informs the templating engine that this template “extends” another template, layout.html. This establishes the link between the templates.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Flask + Pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the code from the `routes.py` file before refactoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data set comes from this link at the World Bank's data repository:\n",

    "### Beyond a CSV file¶\n",
    "Besides storing data in a local csv file (or text, json, etc.), you could also store the data in a database such as a SQL database.\n",
    "\n",
